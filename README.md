# Personal Environment

> [!NOTE]
> This repository is suited for my personal workflow, and may not suit your needs.

A work in progress repository to consolidate my personal environments (
[vkhitrin/macos-env](https://github.com/vkhitrin/macos-env),
[vkhitrin/arch-linux-env](https://github.com/vkhitrin/arch-linux-env)) into a single repository.

Dotfiles are stored externally in a separate repository [vkhitrin/dotfiles](https://github.com/vkhitrin/dotfiles) (
Inspired by [@anandpiyer](https://github.com/anandpiyer)'s [blog post](https://www.anand-iyer.com/blog/2018/a-simpler-way-to-manage-your-dotfiles/)).

## General

- Each distribution imports a unique Makefile.
- Common scripts import shared Makefile(s).
